This file contains a Jupyter notebook (test.ipynb), which provides an interactive environment to explore and replicate the study's computational analysis. Within this notebook, you'll find detailed Python code that processes motion capture data, performs ergonomic assessments using established cognitive load metrics, and visualizes the effects of prolonged AR engagement on user posture.

This update aims to enrich the research community with tools and insights required to further investigate AR's ergonomic considerations. The notebook stands as a testament to the meticulous data analysis conducted and encourages collaborative development to enhance real-time intervention strategies. Through sharing this work, we invite others to engage with the findings, contribute to the ongoing narrative of AR and ergonomics, and aid in the development of AR technologies that prioritize user health and comfort in educational and other extended-use scenarios.
